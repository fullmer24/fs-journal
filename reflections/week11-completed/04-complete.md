## Questions

Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your `final project`, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.

Holy cow what a ride its been. I've never felt so many highs and lows strung together in a consecutive rollercoaster like I experienced with this course. 

I'm feeling confidant but also very nervous. The only concern I have is getting discouraged and slowing down. I've had a tendency to get inside my own head and start feeling like I have no idea what I'm doing until I get past the problem I'm working on and then it's smooth sailing again. 

I will be using time-boxing when I run into problems and I will also be putting in more at home hours on this app.

I have loved learning about programming. I am excited to get my skills more well rounded to deliver visually appealing and fully functioning websites.
