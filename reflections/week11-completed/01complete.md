## Questions

1. What does Inheritance accomplish for us in C#?

Inheritance, in C#, is the ability to create a class that inherits attributes and behaviors from an existing class. The newly created class is the derived (or child) class and the existing class is the base (or parent) class.

2. How does Member inheritance work in C#? Does a class inherit all members of the base class?

Child classes inherit Members from its parent class. Not all members of a base class are inherited by derived classes. The following members are not inherited: Static constructors, which initialize the static data of a class. Instance constructors, which you call to create a new instance of the class.

3. How does accessibility affect inheritance?

The accessibility level controls whether they can be used from other parts of your code. 

PUBLIC: The type or member can be accessed by any other code in the same assembly or another assembly that references it. The accessibility level of public members of a type is controlled by the accessibility level of the type itself.

PRIVATE: The type or member can be accessed only by code in the same class or struct.
