## Questions

1. What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?

The three type of testing in Vue is Unit Testing, Component Testing, and End-To-End Testing.

2. What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?

The most useful in my eyes is unit testing because it allows you to test and correct smaller sections of code.

3. What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?

Naming a least useful method of testing is counter intuitive. They are all useful and important in their own ways. If I had to say one was the least useful I would go with end-to-end testing. If you've tested every part of your code in smaller sections it should work as a final product.
