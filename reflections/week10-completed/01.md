## Questions

1. What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?

Value type if it holds a data value within its own memory space.
Pointer type just points to a spot in memory.
Reference type doesnâ€™t store its value directly. Instead, it stores the address where the value is being stored.

2. What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?

 All numeric data types. Boolean , Char , and Date. All structures, even if their members are reference types. They are mostly the same.

3. In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?

Reference types store pointers that point to another memory location where as value types hold their own memory.
