## Questions

1. In a SQL table, what is the difference between information in a row and information in a column?

The key difference between columns and rows is that a column arranges data vertically from top to bottom, while a row arranges data horizontally from left to right.

2. Demonstrate the basic structure for creating a new table called `characters` with the values `name, age, description` as strings, and an `int` id.

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS characters(
    id INT,
    name STRING,
    age INT,
    description STRING
)


3. What are the difference between the following statements: 
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name;
This will remove one.
DROP TABLE table_name;
This is remove the entire table.
```
