> **ðŸ“– [Callback Hell](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk4/01-Callbacks)**

## Questions

1. What are some of the signs and causes of `Callback Hell`?

Some of the signs of callback hell is that the code block has a pyramid shape and many nested )} at the end. It is caused by poor coding practices. 

2. What does the asynchronous mean and how are callbacks involved?

Asynchronous means it either takes time to run or will be ran at some point in the future. Callbacks are involved by running the code at the designated point.

3. Summarize the 3 ways to avoid / fix `Callback Hell`

The first way is to write shallow code. Break it into smaller chunks instead of letting it run on.
Secondly, is to modularize. Write multiple modules and combine them into other modules.
The third way is to make sure you handle every error regardless of source.
