## Questions

1. In simple terms what is timeboxing?

Time boxing is scheduling blocks of time in which you will be actively working, separated by short breaks. 

2. What three strategies will you implement and how?

The main strategy I plan on using is "Breaking Parkinson's Law", plan on getting done with tasks sooner. Also, utilizing my "Golden Hour", I seem to work best first thing in the morning. Lastly, the one I see being of the most use to me personally is "Swallowing the Frog", if I wait to do the part I'm dreading I tend to burn out quicker and have to fight myself to get it done in a timely manner.

3. Give an example of when you would have benefitted from timeboxing and how? 

When I run into problems I don't time box well and end up working on something until I get burned out and frustrated to the point that when I do finally take a break it's hard for me to want to go back to working on it. I end up wasting more time during breaks than I make up by working no a problem straight through
