## Questions

1. What are the three types of relationships?

The three types of relationships are one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many.

2. What are the benefits of the traditional `linking` of relationships instead of `Embedding`

With linking you can use any of the three relationship types but embedded is preferred with one-to-one relationships.

3. What are some of the challenges faced when deciding how to manage a many-to-many relationship that ultimately drive your decision on how to create it?

The biggest challenge is deciding if you will use embedding or linking, and if embedding, which type of embedding to use.
