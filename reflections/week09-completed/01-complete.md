## Questions

1. What technologies and principles are you using in your project?

We used RapidApi, and MongoDB

2. What went well so far?

We worked very well together as a team.

3. What would you do differently? Why?

Not be remote for the first week. It was very unexpected and I didn't have time to prepare and was forced to make adjustment on the fly and it left me feeling lost in the project.
