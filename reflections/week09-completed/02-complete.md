## Questions

1. What is a Github action and how do they work?

GitHub Actions is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that allows you to automate your build, test, and deployment pipeline. You can create workflows that build and test every pull request to your repository, or deploy merged pull requests to production. GitHub Actions connects all of your tools to automate every step of your development workflow.

2. What benefits do Github actions provide?

The benefits of GitHub Actions. Automate everything within the GitHub flow: Actions gives you the ability to implement powerful automations right in your repositories. You can create your own actions or use readily available actions on the GitHub Marketplace to integrate your preferred tools right into your repository.

3. What types of trigger actions can a workflow use? What do they do?

Rules
A rule trigger initiates a workflow based on one of the following:

contact email actions. For example, you can define a trigger that initiates a workflow when a contact clicks on a link about a service. The workflow might update the contact's record using an existing custom field that identifies customers interested in that service.
form submissions. For example, you can define a trigger that initiates a workflow when a contact unsubscribes from your monthly newsletter. The workflow might send an email reminding the contact that they can sign up again at any time.
contact fields. For example, you can define a trigger that initiates a workflow when a contact's email address changes. The workflow might send an email to confirm the change.
list memberships. For example, you can define a trigger that initiates a workflow when a contact is added to your VIP Customers static segment. The workflow might send an email that describes the added benefits now available to the customer. In addition to triggering workflows based on a contact's membership in static segments, you can also trigger workflows based on a contact's membership to a mailing list.  
Tip: For convenience, you can create a mailing list when defining the rule.

Timer
A timer trigger initiates a workflow based on a schedule and targets a specific mailing list or segment. For example, you can define a trigger that sends an email campaign on a recurring basis to a segment, such as a Birthday email campaign to a segment of contacts with birthdays in the current month. While a workflow with a timer trigger type is active, you can see the next time it will be triggered on the Workflow Summary. The time appears in the Activity Summary area.

API
API triggers are intended for use with our application programming interface (API). For information about API triggers, see the API documentation provided with your development kit for our email marketing application
