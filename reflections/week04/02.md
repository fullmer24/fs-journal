## Questions

1. What are the three states of a `Promise`?

The three states of promise are:
Pending, which is the initial state before the promise succeeds or fails.
Resoled, which is when a promise has been completed. 
and Rejected, which occurs when a promise has failed. 

2. How do `promise`s seek to resolve the issues of "callback hell"?

Promises help to resolve callback hell by chaining callbacks to the end of the code so that the callbacks only get ran one time instead of for every instance.

3. What is the difference between `.then()` and `.catch()`?

The difference between then and catch is:
Then is used when the promise is resolved and we want a code to run,
Catch is for when the promise is rejected and you want an error printed to the page or console.
