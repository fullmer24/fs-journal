## Questions

1. What is Pair Programming? What are the roles and how do they work?

Pair programming consists of two programmers sharing a single workstation. The programmer at the keyboard is usually called the ‚Äúdriver‚Äù, the other, also actively involved in the programming task but focusing more on overall direction is the ‚Äúnavigator‚Äù; it is expected that the programmers swap roles every few minutes or so.

2. What are some benefits of Pair Programming?

The benefits of pair programming is increased code quality: ‚Äúprogramming out loud‚Äù leads to clearer articulation of the complexities and hidden details in coding tasks, reducing the risk of errors. There is also a better transfer of skills, as junior developers pick up techniques or skills from more experienced team members.

3. What are some drawbacks to Pair Programming?

The drawbacks of pair programming is that both programmers must be actively engaging with the task throughout a paired session, otherwise no benefit can be expected. Also, the pairs may not always be a good match for working together.
