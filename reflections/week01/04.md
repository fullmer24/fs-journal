## Questions

1. What is the purpose of wire-framing? 
To design the layout of your website and share it with others in way that is easy to make. 

2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?
The levels of wire-frame are Lo, Mid, and High fidelity. They are useful separately to show each step and reiteration of the final product.

3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?
Yes I believe they are worth the TEE because then you have an idea and goal when you start writing code opposed to wasting TEE trying to do the design and write the code at the same time, which can lead to confusion.
