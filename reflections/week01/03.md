## Questions

1. What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?

My favorite tip is that using too many borders can make your project appear cluttered.

2. Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.

I personally prefer W3 Schools templates for example websites. 
There is also freewebsitetemplates.com, as well as, bootstrapmade.com

3. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?

A good design will help your website because people will be more likely to use your site if it has a smooth and functioning user interface. Design alone can convey the programmers competency and experience.
