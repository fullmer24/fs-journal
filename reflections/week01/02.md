## Questions

1. What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use

pseudo-Classes are used to add styles but only when certain conditions are met. I think the ones that will be most commonly used are; checked, hover, target.

2. What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?

Specificity determines what rule should be applied in the case where there are multiple rules targeting the same element. We can use it to modify code in instances when reading the code top to bottom won't return the desired outcome.

3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?

Everything will have the highest specificity which will lead to confusion within css.
